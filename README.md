** VarClassFDR -Variant peptide class FDR calculator**

Measurement of False Discovery Rate (FDR) specific to variant peptides (class-FDR) for is crucial their accurate identification and removes any false hits being considered as true hits based on Global-FDR calculation. Therefore, we developed a Python-based tool for the calculation of class-FDR for variant peptides identified using database search in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific).
